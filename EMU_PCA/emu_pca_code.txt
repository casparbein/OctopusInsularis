### EMU-PCA workflow
### The following input vcf files were used: 69inds_40MD, 64inds_20MD
### after conversion bed format with plink (3 files with the following extensions: .bed, .fam, .bim),
### the following command was run for eigenvalues (-e) 2 to 11:

python ../emu/emu.py -p 69inds_40MD -t 10 --iter 500 -o 69inds_40MD_2 -f 0.001 -e X

### -p: input file prefix (all 3 bed files need to have the same prefix), -t: number of threads, --iter: number of iterations (if ommitted, EMU PCA runs until conversion)
### -f minimum allele frequency filtering (the algorithm cannot handle pure singletons)
